# Myanmar POS Tagging Based on Machine Translation

• This project compares the performances achieved by Phrase-Based Statistical 
Machine Translation system(PBSMT), Neural Machine Translation based on 
sequence model of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), and Attention-Based Neural 
Machine Translation systems (NMT) when translating Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS 
tagging) in Myanmar Language. <br>
• Part of speeches are very fundamental in a language and various languages had 
done in tagging part-of-speech and the use of tag sets vary upon each own 
language. <br>
• Important in Linguistics and part of speech tags can be used in building of 
Parse-tree(used in NERs) and for lemmatizers and many other NLP tasks. 
• The systems are built on a parallel Myanmar-POS tagging corpus with word 
segmented 10k text. <br>
• Through the research, PBSMT outperforms NMT. PBSMT also has a much higher 
evaluation score in  comparison. <br>
• Experiment's performances are evaluated with RIBES score, BLEU score, and 
ChrF++.<br>
